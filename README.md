`dist/` is left out on purpose — it's build output, not source, and doesn't belong in version control or documentation.

## ⚙️ Installation

```bash
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hrms-dashboard.git

# Go to project
cd hrms-dashboard/FrontEnd

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server
npm run dev
```

---


```

Restart the dev server after creating or editing this file — Vite only reads env vars at startup.

---

## 🚀 Deployment

Deploy on Vercel or Netlify. Add the environment variables above in your deployment platform's settings — they won't be picked up from a local `.env` file in production.
